base64 = "Base64 is an encoding method that transforms binary data into text format using 64 different ASCII characters. It's widely used to transmit data over media that handle text, ensuring the data remains unchanged. Base64 is prevalent in web development for embedding images and other files within HTML or CSS files."
base32 = "Base32 is a binary-to-text encoding scheme that uses a set of 32 different characters to represent binary data in a text format. This encoding is particularly useful for systems that require data to be in a readable ASCII format. It's commonly used in email and URL encoding to ensure the integrity of data during transmission. The Base32 encoding is designed to be case-insensitive and to minimize the possibility of misinterpretation by human operators, making it a robust choice for data handling in various applications."
hex_base16 = "he hexadecimal numeral system is a positional numeral system that represents numbers using a radix (base) of sixteen."
