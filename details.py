base64 = "Base64 is an encoding method that transforms binary data into text format using 64 different ASCII characters. It's widely used to transmit data over media that handle text, ensuring the data remains unchanged. Base64 is prevalent in web development for embedding images and other files within HTML or CSS files."
base32 = "Base32 is a binary-to-text encoding scheme that uses a set of 32 different characters to represent binary data in a text format. This encoding is particularly useful for systems that require data to be in a readable ASCII format. It's commonly used in email and URL encoding to ensure the integrity of data during transmission. The Base32 encoding is designed to be case-insensitive and to minimize the possibility of misinterpretation by human operators, making it a robust choice for data handling in various applications."
hex_base16 = "Hexadecimal, or hex, is a base-16 number system that uses sixteen symbols to represent values. It’s a compact and human-readable way to represent binary data, especially useful in computing, digital systems, and cryptography. In hex, numbers are represented with digits 0-9 and letters A-F(10-15)"
sha1 = "SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1) is a cryptographic hash function that takes an input (such as a message or file) and produces a 160-bit (20-byte) hash value, often displayed as a 40-digit hexadecimal number. SHA-1 is commonly used to verify data integrity, as any change in the input results in a different hash, making it possible to detect alterations."
sha224 = "SHA-224 is a cryptographic hash function that is part of the SHA-2 family, designed by the National Security Agency (NSA) and published in 2001. It produces a 224-bit hash value and is based on the SHA-256 algorithm, with some modifications."
rot13 = "a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it in the Latin alphabet"
Morse = "Morse code is a method of encoding text characters as sequences of dots and dashes (or short and long signals) that can be transmitted as sound, light, or visual signals."
binary = "Binary is a base-2 numeral system that uses two symbols: typically 0 and 1. It is the foundation of all binary code used in computer systems and digital electronics, including programming languages, data storage, and network communications."

url = "URL encoding is essential to ensure that URLs are transmitted and interpreted correctly by browsers and servers."

whitespace = "Whitespace is an esoteric programming language, designed with a unique twist: only spaces, tabs, and line breaks are meaningful."
brainfk = "Brainf**k was designed as a very minimal language, operating on only eight commands. Despite its simplicity, it's Turing-complete, meaning it can theoretically perform any computation that a regular programming language can."
chicken = 'Chicken is a language in which the only valid keyword is "chicken." The number of repetitions of "chicken" determines the operation.'
false_ascii = "(similar to ASCII but contains \"a\" keyword) original FALSE language, which uses ASCII characters for its syntax and commands. It is designed to be minimalistic and concise"
false_binary = "(similar to binary but without spaces) FALSE have been created in binary form, where the commands are represented in binary code rather than ASCII text."


# cipher
xor_cipher = "XOR cipher is a simple encryption algorithm that uses the XOR (exclusive disjunction) operation to encrypt and decrypt data."
caesar_cipher = "Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest and simplest encryption techniques. Each letter in the text is shifted by a fixed number of positions."
atbash_cipher = "Atbash Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter is mapped to its reverse in the alphabet (e.g., A ↔ Z, B ↔ Y)."
vigenere_cipher = "Vigenère Cipher uses a keyword to shift each character of the plaintext by different amounts based on the keyword's letters."
